                            This is where the lost poets, artists, and musicians land. <br>
                            The Olympian Champions! <br>
                            But careful not to outshine, <br>
                            The Golden God, <br>
                            Whom is no other than I, <br>
                            Phoebus Apollo, <br>
                            The Almighty, <br>
                            The Sun, <br>
                            The Creative, <br>
                            The God of all Arts, <br>
                            Medicine, <br>
                            Archery, <br>
                            Prophecies, <br>
                            And of course, <br>
                            Beauty, <br>
                            But not to be confused with the <br>
                            Almighty Goddess Aphrodite, <br>
                            For even I shall not <br>
                            Incur her wrath. <br>

                            May you never dare to challenge me. <br>
                            Lest you be flayed, <br>
                            As the Great Satyre did. <br>
                            Nonethless, <br>
                            I welcome thee <br>

                            For you, <br>
                            And not Me, <br>
                            to be here. <br>
